# NGINX

# What is NGINX?

---

Nginx is an **open-source**, **high-performance web server** and r**everse proxy server**. Here's a brief description of its key functions:

- **Web Server:** Nginx can serve static files, such as HTML, CSS, and image files, directly to clients.
- **Reverse Proxy:** It can act as a reverse proxy server, managing client requests and distributing them to multiple backend servers. This is useful for load balancing and improving performance.
- **Load Balancer:** Nginx can function as a load balancer to distribute traffic among several backend servers, enhancing scalability and availability.
- **HTTPS Management:** It provides capabilities for handling the HTTPS (SSL/TLS) protocol to ensure web communication security.
- **Caching:** It can cache static content to reduce the load on backend servers and improve loading times.
- **Mail Server:** Although not its primary function, Nginx can also be used as a mail server for the IMAP/POP3 protocols.

### Servers

---

Using NGINX you can configure different servers, and has a *default* server. There are various types of configurations: we can create a specific server that contains rules only for that server or generate rules for the default server. You can use `server` to create a new instance of a server in Nginx.

In this example, we configure a server, and all requests directed to the subdomain `example.*` will be handled by this server. Additionally, we specify that it only listens on port 80 and has a maximum request size of 100 megabytes.

```scss
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name patata.*$;
    client_max_body_size 100M;
}
```

<aside>
⚠️ As we have seen in the previous example, Nginx allows the use of regular expressions (**REGEX**) to specify some of its configurations, such as `proxypass`  or `server` .

</aside>

### Server alias

---

Nginx allows to create multiple aliases for a server through `upstream` . In the following example, we see how the server with the address `backoffice:8081`  is given the alias name `backoffice` . Additional context is provided in the example to understand where the upstream directive is placed in a configuration block.

```scss
upstream backoffice {
    server backoffice:8081;
}

server {
    listen 80;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://backoffice;
    }
}
```

### Redirection rules

---

Each of the redirection rules is named `proxy_pass`. In the following example, we will see how they are configured:

```scss
location [path name] {
    proxy_pass [redirects to path];
}

location /api {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:1880/;
}
```

<aside>
⚠️ There are subtle but important nuances to consider

</aside>

If the `/` character is **included at the end of the destination server address**, Nginx is instructed to preserve the path of the incoming request and append it to the destination server address. 

- For example, if a user accesses `http://example.com/some/path`, and the Nginx configuration includes proxy_pass `http://localhost/`, the request will be redirected to `http://localhost/some/path`.
    
    ```scss
    location /some/path {
        proxy_pass http://my_db_url/;
    }
    ```
    
    The previous rule redirects to `http://my_db_url/some/path` 
    

If the `/`  character is **NOT** **included** at the end of the destination server address, Nginx is instructed to ignore the path of the incoming request and use the destination server address as is. 

- For example, if a user accesses `http://example.com/some/path`, and the Nginx configuration includes proxy-pass `http://localhost`, the request will be redirected to `http://localhost`
    
    ```scss
    location /some/path {
        proxy_pass http://my_db_url;
    }
    ```
    
    The previous rule redirects to `http://my_db_url/` 
    

### Importing configurations

---

In each of the Nginx configuration files, we can concatenate other configurations. This is done using the **`include`** directive. In the following example, we will see how all configuration files within the folder `/etc/nginx/conf.d/_services/`  whose names end in `.service.conf`  are included.

```scss
{
    server {
        listen 80;
    }
    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/_services/*.service.conf;
}
```
