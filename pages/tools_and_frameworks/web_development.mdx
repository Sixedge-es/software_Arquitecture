</Callout>

## Java

- ### Spring boot
    Spring Boot is an open-source Java-based framework that simplifies the process of building and deploying production-ready applications. It also can be developed with Kotlin instead of Java

- ####  Kotlin
    Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be used to develop a wide range of applications. Is designed to be fully interoperable with Java, meaning that Kotlin code can seamlessly call Java code and vice versa. It is the official android language.
        

## Javascript

- ### NodeJS
    Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server. It also can support Typescript instead of Javascript

- ### ExpressJS
    Popular and widely-used web application framework for Node.js. Express.js simplifies the process of building robust and scalable **APIs** by providing a set of features and tools for handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, middleware, and more.

    #### What is Typescript?
        TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which can be checked by the TypeScript compiler during development. Typescript runs only in build time, not run time.
        


## Python

- ### Django / Fast API / Flask
    Frameworks to build APIs

## Go Lang
    Used for scenarios with high concurrency and low latency are crucial

## Rust
    Used for scenarios with high performance, is more human friendly and easy to understand than C++ or Go. It is gaining high popularity
