# Git Version Control

## **How to make good commits?**

---

- **Atomic Commits:** Each commit should represent an atomic change and focus on a specific task. Avoid mixing unrelated changes in a single commit.
- **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- **Do not commit breaking code:** Only commit code if and only if it works. If the code doesn't work and you need to commit, add a **toggle variable** that allows deactivating the non-functional code. This variable should be committed in a state that does not affect people pulling the project.
- **Avoid Massive Commits:** Avoid making massive commits that include unrelated changes such as linters or files not related to the specific commit change.

### **Interesting Commands**

---

- If we want to go back to a specific commit, we can do so with the following command: **`git checkout ${commit}`**
- Roll back a commit: **`git revert ${commit}`**
