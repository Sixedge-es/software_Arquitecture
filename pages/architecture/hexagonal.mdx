# Hexagonal Architecture

## What it is?

Architecture pattern that aims to create **loosely** **coupled** **components** that can be easily connected to their software environment through **ports** and **adapters**. Is particularly useful for applications where **business logic** needs to be **kept separate** from **external** **concerns** like **databases**, **user** **interfaces**, and **other services**.


### What are ports?

Ports are interfaces that define how the **application** can **interact** with the **outside world**. Ports represent the **primary way to interact with the application's core logic**. There are typically **two types of ports.**

- **Primary or Driving Ports: These are used by the application to expose its features to the outside world, like a RESTful HTTP interface for a web application.**
- **Secondary or Driven Ports: These are used by the application to interact with external systems, like databases or messaging services.**

### What are adapters?

These are implementations that **connect the ports to the external systems** or technologies. Adapters translate requests from the external world (external to the core application logic) into a format that the application can understand, and vice versa.

- **Primary or Driving Adapters: These adapt the external input to the application, like a web interface or a REST API.**
- **Secondary or Driven Adapters: These adapt the application to the external services it must use, like a database or a message broker.**

### What is central core?

At the **heart** of the architecture is the **application's core** **logic (business logic)**, which is **decoupled** from **external** **concerns (usually using DDD)**.

## Characteristics

- **Separation of Concerns:** Clearly **separates the application's core logic** **from external concerns** like user interfaces, data storage, and external services. **This separation helps in maintaining a clean boundary around the application**.
- **Independent of Technology:** Because of the use of ports and adapters, the **core application logic remains independent of the technology used** in the adapters (like web frameworks, database technologies).
- **Facilitates Testability: Easy unit testing of the application core without requiring external elements** like databases or web servers. You can create test adapters to simulate real-world interactions.
- **Flexibility and Maintainability: Changes in external dependencies or technologies do not impact the core business logic**. You can replace or update external components with minimal changes to the core application
- **Scalability: As it is easy to add new adapters to extend the application’s functionality** without modifying the core logic.
- **Multiple Interface Support:** Allows an application to **interact with multiple types of clients or services through different adapters**. This is particularly useful in situations where the same application **logic is accessed in various ways** (e.g., web, API, console).
- **Domain-Centric Design:** The **core of the application focuses on domain logic, emphasizing the importance of the business rules over technical aspects**.

    ### ✅ Pros
    - **Decoupling:**  It decouples the core logic of the application from external components, which leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.
    - **Testability**: The separation of concerns facilitates testing. The core logic can be tested in isolation from external systems.
    - **Flexibility and Adaptability**: It's easier to replace or modify adapters without affecting the core logic.
    - **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different parts of the system (adapters vs. core logic) independently.
    - **Multiple Interfaces:** The application can interact with multiple types of clients and servers through different adapters.

    ### ❌ Cons
    - **Complexity**: For simple applications, this pattern can introduce unnecessary complexity.
    - **Overhead**: More interfaces and classes (ports and adapters) can mean more overhead in understanding and maintaining the application.
    - **Design Challenges**: Properly identifying and designing ports and adapters can be challenging, especially in evolving domains.
